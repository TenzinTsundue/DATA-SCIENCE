Functions: A body of reusable code for performing specific processes or tasks
* code reusability
* Functions and methods are very similar, but there are a few key differences. Methods are a specific type of function. They are functions that belong to a class. This means that you can use them—or “call” them—by using dot notation. 

**Python operator**
* Comparators
	* >, >=, <, <=, !=, ==*
* Logical operator
	* and, or, not
* Arithmetic operators
	* +, -, *, /, %, **, // (Modulo, Exponentiation, Floor division)

*elif*: A reserved keyword that executes subsequent conditions when the previous conditions are not true  <br>
*else*: A reserved keyword that executes when preceding conditions evaluate as False <br>
*Function*: A body of reusable code for performing specific processes or tasks <br>
*if*: A reserved keyword that sets up a condition in Python <br>
*Logical operator*: An operator that connects multiple statements together and performs complex comparisons <br>
*Modularity*: The ability to write code in separate components that work together and that can be reused for other programs <br>
*Modulo*: An operator that returns the remainder when one number is divided by another <br>
*Refactoring*: The process of restructuring code while maintaining its original functionality <br>
*return*: A reserved keyword in Python that makes a function produce new results which are saved for later use <br>
*Reusability*: The capability to define code once and using it many times without having to rewrite it <br>
*Self-documenting code*: Code written in a way that is readable and makes its purpose clear <br>
