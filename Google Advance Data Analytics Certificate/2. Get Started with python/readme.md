*Argument*: Information given to a function in its parentheses<br>
*Assignment*: The process of storing a value in a variable<br>
*Attribute*: A value associated with an object or class which is referenced by name using dot notation<br>
*Cells*: The modular code input and output fields into which Jupyter Notebooks are partitioned<br>
*Class*: An object’s data type that bundles data and functionality together<br>
*Computer programming*: The process of giving instructions to a computer to perform an action or set of actions<br>
*Data type*: An attribute that describes a piece of data based on its values, its programming language, or the operations it can perform<br>
*Dot notation*: How to access the methods and attributes that belong to an instance of a class<br>
*Dynamic typing*: Variables that can point to objects of any data type<br>
*Explicit conversion*: The process of converting a data type of an object to a required data type<br>
*Expression*: A combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated<br>
*Float*: A data type that represents numbers that contain decimals<br>
*Immutable data type*: A data type in which the values can never be altered or updated<br>
*Implicit conversion*: The process Python uses to automatically convert one data type to another without user involvement<br>

*Naming conventions*: Consistent guidelines that describe the content, creation date, and version of a file in its name<br>
*Naming restrictions*: Rules built into the syntax of a programming language <br>
*Object*: An instance of a class; a fundamental building block of Python<br>
*Object-oriented programming*: A programming system that is based around objects which can contain both data and code that manipulates that data<br>
*Programming languages*: The words and symbols used to write instructions for computers to follow<br>
*String*: A sequence of characters and punctuation that contains textual information<br>
*Syntax*: The structure of code words, symbols, placement, and punctuation<br>
