**Argument**: Information given to a function in its parentheses<br>
**Assignment**: The process of storing a value in a variable<br>
**Attribute**: A value associated with an object or class which is referenced by name using dot notation<br>
**Cells**: The modular code input and output fields into which Jupyter Notebooks are partitioned<br>
**Class**: An object’s data type that bundles data and functionality together<br>
**Computer programming**: The process of giving instructions to a computer to perform an action or set of actions<br>
**Data type*: An attribute that describes a piece of data based on its values, its programming language, or the operations it can perform<br>
**Dot notation**: How to access the methods and attributes that belong to an instance of a class<br>
**Dynamic typing**: Variables that can point to objects of any data type<br>
**Explicit conversion**: The process of converting a data type of an object to a required data type<br>
**Expression**: A combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated<br>
**Float**: A data type that represents numbers that contain decimals<br>
**Immutable data type**: A data type in which the values can never be altered or updated<br>
**Implicit conversion**: The process Python uses to automatically convert one data type to another without user involvement<br>
**Integer**: A data type used to represent whole numbers without fractions<br>
**Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing documents containing live code, mathematical formulas, visualizations, and text<br>
**Keyword**: A special word in a programming language that is reserved for a specific purpose and that can only be used for that purpose<br>
**Markdown**: A markup language that lets the user write formatted text in a coding environment or plain-text editor <br>
**Method**: A function that belongs to a class and typically performs an action or operation<br>
**Naming conventions**: Consistent guidelines that describe the content, creation date, and version of a file in its name<br>
**Naming restrictions**: Rules built into the syntax of a programming language <br>
**Object**: An instance of a class; a fundamental building block of Python<br>
**Object-oriented programming**: A programming system that is based around objects which can contain both data and code that manipulates that data<br>
**Programming languages**: The words and symbols used to write instructions for computers to follow<br>
**String**: A sequence of characters and punctuation that contains textual information<br>
**Syntax**: The structure of code words, symbols, placement, and punctuation<br>
**Variable**: A named container which stores values in a reserved location in the computer’s memory<br>

Functions: A body of reusable code for performing specific processes or tasks
* code reusability
* Functions and methods are very similar, but there are a few key differences. Methods are a specific type of function. They are functions that belong to a class. This means that you can use them—or “call” them—by using dot notation. 

**Python operator**
* Comparators
	* >, >=, <, <=, !=, ==*
* Logical operator
	* and, or, not
* Arithmetic operators
	* +, -, *, /, %, **, // (Modulo, Exponentiation, Floor division) 

*Algorithm*: A set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task
*Boolean*: A data type that has only two possible values, usually true or false
*Branching*: The ability of a program to alter its execution sequence
*Comparator*: An operator that compares two values and produces Boolean values (True/False)
*def*: A keyword that defines a function at the start of the function block
*Docstring*: A string at the beginning of a function’s body that summarizes the function’s behavior and explains its arguments and return values
*elif*: A reserved keyword that executes subsequent conditions when the previous conditions are not true 
*else*: A reserved keyword that executes when preceding conditions evaluate as False
*Function*: A body of reusable code for performing specific processes or tasks
*if*: A reserved keyword that sets up a condition in Python
*Logical operator*: An operator that connects multiple statements together and performs complex comparisons
*Modularity*: The ability to write code in separate components that work together and that can be reused for other programs
*Modulo*: An operator that returns the remainder when one number is divided by another
*Refactoring*: The process of restructuring code while maintaining its original functionality
*return*: A reserved keyword in Python that makes a function produce new results which are saved for later use
*Reusability*: The capability to define code once and using it many times without having to rewrite it
*Self-documenting code*: Code written in a way that is readable and makes its purpose clear
