### Week 1: Find and share stories using data <br>

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often employing data wrangling and visualization methods <br>
* Discovering: Data professionals familiarize themselves with the data so they can start conceptualizing how to use it.
* Structuring: The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled
* Cleaning: The process of removing errors that may distort your data or make it less useful
* Joining: The process of augmenting or adjusting dat any adding values from other datasets
* Validating: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality
* Presenting: Making your cleaned dataset or data visualizations available to others for analysis or further modeling

Data Visualization: A graph, chart, diagram, or the dashboard that is created as a representation of information  <br>

*Bias*: In data structuring, refers to organizing data results in groupings, categories, or variables that are misrepresentative of the whole dataset <br>				
*Cleaning*: The process of removing errors that might distort your data or make it less useful; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Data visualization*: A graph, chart, diagram, or dashboard that is created as a representation of information <br>
*Discovering*: The process data professionals use to familiarize themselves with the data so they can start conceptualizing how to use it; one of the six practices of EDA	 <br>
*Exploratory data analysis (EDA)*: The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often by employing data wrangling and visualization methods; the six main practices of EDA are: discovering, structuring, cleaning, joining, validating, and presenting <br>					
*Joining*: The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*PACE*: A workflow data professionals can use to remain focused on the end goal of any given dataset; stands for plan, analyze, construct, and execute <br>
*Presenting*: The process of making a cleaned dataset available to others for analysis or further modeling; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Structuring*: The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Validating*: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality; one of the six practices of EDA <br>	

Week 2: Explore raw data <br>

First-party data is data that was gathered from inside your own organization.  <br>
Second-party data was gathered outside your organization but directly from the original source.  <br>
Third-party data, which is data gathered outside your organization and aggregated. <br>

head(), info(), describe() and shape <br>

Hypothesis: A theory or an explanation, based on evidence, that is not yet proved true.
