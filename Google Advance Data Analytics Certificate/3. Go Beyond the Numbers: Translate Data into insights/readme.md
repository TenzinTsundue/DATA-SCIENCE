### Week 1: Find and share stories using data <br>

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often employing data wrangling and visualization methods <br>
* Discovering: Data professionals familiarize themselves with the data so they can start conceptualizing how to use it.
* Structuring: The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled
* Cleaning: The process of removing errors that may distort your data or make it less useful
* Joining: The process of augmenting or adjusting dat any adding values from other datasets
* Validating: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality
* Presenting: Making your cleaned dataset or data visualizations available to others for analysis or further modeling

Data Visualization: A graph, chart, diagram, or the dashboard that is created as a representation of information  <br>

*Bias*: In data structuring, refers to organizing data results in groupings, categories, or variables that are misrepresentative of the whole dataset <br>				
*Cleaning*: The process of removing errors that might distort your data or make it less useful; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Data visualization*: A graph, chart, diagram, or dashboard that is created as a representation of information <br>
*Discovering*: The process data professionals use to familiarize themselves with the data so they can start conceptualizing how to use it; one of the six practices of EDA	 <br>
*Exploratory data analysis (EDA)*: The process of investigating, organizing, and analyzing datasets and summarizing their main characteristics, often by employing data wrangling and visualization methods; the six main practices of EDA are: discovering, structuring, cleaning, joining, validating, and presenting <br>					
*Joining*: The process of augmenting data by adding values from other datasets; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*PACE*: A workflow data professionals can use to remain focused on the end goal of any given dataset; stands for plan, analyze, construct, and execute <br>
*Presenting*: The process of making a cleaned dataset available to others for analysis or further modeling; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Structuring*: The process of taking raw data and organizing or transforming it to be more easily visualized, explained, or modeled; one of the six practices of EDA <br>
*Validating*: The process of verifying that the data is consistent and high quality; one of the six practices of EDA <br>	

### Week 2: Explore raw data <br>

First-party data is data that was gathered from inside your own organization.  <br>
Second-party data was gathered outside your organization but directly from the original source.  <br>
Third-party data, which is data gathered outside your organization and aggregated. <br>

head(), info(), describe() and shape <br>

Hypothesis: A theory or an explanation, based on evidence, that is not yet proved true. <be>

pd.concat()
df.join()
df.select_dtypes
df[condition]

*Box plot:*A data visualization that depicts the locality, spread, and skew of groups of values within quartiles <br>
*CSV file*: A simple text file that can be easy to import or store in other softwares, platforms, and databases <br>
*Database (DB) file*: A file type used to store data, often in tables, indexes, or fields <br>
*Data source:* The location where data originates <br>
*Extracting:* The process of retrieving data out of data sources for further data processing or storage <br>
*Filtering:* The process of selecting a smaller part of a dataset based on specified values and using it for viewing or analysis <br>
*First-party data:* Data that was gathered from inside your own organization <br>
*Grouping*: The process of aggregating individual observations of a variable into groups <br>
*Hypothesis:* A theory or an explanation, based on evidence, that is not yet proven true <br>
*Info():* Gives the total number of entries, along with the data types—called Dtypes in pandas—of the individual entries <br>
*Int64:* A standard integer data type, representing numbers somewhere between negative nine quintillion and positive nine quintillion <br>
*JSON file:*A data storage file that is saved in a JavaScript format <br>
*Merging:* A method to combine two (or more) different data frames along a specified starting column(s) <br>
*Second-party data:* Data that was gathered outside your organization but directly from the original source <br>
